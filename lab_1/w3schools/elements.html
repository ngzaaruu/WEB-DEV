<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<!-- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:-->
 <h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<!-- HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):-->

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<!--
The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
The <body> element defines the document's body.
The <h1> element defines a heading.
The <p> element defines a paragraph.-->

<!--HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:-->
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
</body>
